                    Pipeline is a community that unites surfers through friendly competition. With the app and sensor combination, track your stats, show off surfing highlights, and connect with others. Build crews of surfers to compete with friends, or view the daily leaderboard for your beaches. Unite globally or locally for a better surf experience.

                    Pipeline’s development started from a random idea had thought of while surfing. While waiting for some waves, I decided that having games and apps on your board would be pretty fun. What I sketched out was a mix of a Tesla and a normal surfboard.

                <p class="body-para">
                    I developed this “surf-bored” idea a bit more with some statistic tracking. I felt that it would be important to view how your surfing and workout went. So I added a sensor to the bottom of the board and a leash that would track bpm, and calories burned. I thought that with an app, everything could be linked together for competition. That’s when I found my niche.

                <p class="body-para">
                    With competition being a key part of the surfing community, I realized that the sensor tracking personal statistics was the way to go. An app would help create the community aspect, almost like Peloton. I then refined the idea to the sensor-app combination and began to brand.

                        After going through logo after logo after logo, I decided that the brand had to be simple. Tech/social media companies generally keep their logos as their brand, with no words needed to describe it. See the images to watch the logo evolve over time.

                        The colors were based on some old style surfing/beach ware that I felt would keep the brand away from the abundance of blue surfing apps online already.

                <p class="body-para">
                    The last step was getting a name for the brand. I brainstormed with a few other people and went through all of the classic surf_______ and ______com ideas, then went to the internet for surfing locations. Pipeline. It’s the most well known surf spot in the world and no other surf companies had this name. It matched the community aspect that the app encouraged as well because of “lines” of communication.

                    This project was something I was super passionate about, so it was easy to work on. I decided that even if I am working on a project, that doesn’t mean much to me, I will convince myself that this is something I am passionate about. It’s definitely an odd process, but it has helped me get genuinely more invested in tons of other projects.

                        Pipeline was also my first real work with logo design and branding. I had to think about what I wanted the company to represent, then what its aesthetic would be. Now this is very different from a redesign because it is something you have to decide, rather than analyze.

                    <p class="body-para light-text">
                        Lastly, I learned how to develop and pitch a business. This was an extremely tedious process that took weeks of nose to the grindstone work, but it was super enjoyable. I understood that this business had to be feasible, desirable, viable, sustainable, and ethical. Technically, a business can just survive with the first three values, but an unethical business is not a good one. Sustainability makes aligns with ethics, but also ensures the business can adapt and stick around.
