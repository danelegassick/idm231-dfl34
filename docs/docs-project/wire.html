                    The Wire is an independent print and online music news magazine that covers alternative, underground
                    and non-mainstream music releases and events while spotlighting artists through essays and
                    interviews.

                    This project was for a User Interface Design II class that required users to redesign a news style
                    sight with formats for mobile, tablet, and desktop. This allowed me to practice responsive design
                    techniques within programs like Figma.

                        The next part of the process was research sketches on potential design ideas. I wasnâ€™t dead set
                        on any of these, but they helped generate ideas for more important prototypes.

                    The color choices had to have some sort of sophistication, but still a more bright color pop,
                    similar to the the magazine covers that they used. Both color palettes 2 and 3 were too bright and
                    colorful for these sorts of text heavy pages, so the first color palette was the one I decided on.
                    Also, the gold matched the high end standard that they hold themselves too.

                    The font choices were designed to keep to that sophisticated style, along with a lot of copy text.
                    The most readable font combination was style 2 and the font family had great cohesion.

                    Lastly, the icons were styled with very minor differences, but the first option was chosen due to
                    the drop shadow providing more clarity on the site.

                        The next steps for this project would be to prototype the project and get feedback from the
                        target audience. This would help shape the user experience and the interface for each platform.
