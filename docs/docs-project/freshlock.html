                    The question posed when tackling this project was how might we reduce the amount of food waste in large family households? In order to tackle this, some basic goals were set so we aimed to create a multi-media solution that helps large families produce less food waste so that families can save money while developing healthy shopping and kitchen habits. We know we are successful if it helps large families produce little to no food waste in areas of leftovers or produce.

                <p class="body-para">
                    The average U.S. household wasted 31.9% of its food, costing families an additional $1,500+ every year. Families with three or more children often had upwards of $1,800 in food waste every year.

                <p class="body-para">
                    Our research consisted of a mix of first-hand and desk research. For the first hand research, we surveyed a small group of people and asked for information on how they stored their food, their shopping habits, and their knowledge of when foods go bad.

                    <p class="body-para">
                        Our data consisted of information on how much of their food goes bad, what food types go bad, if they lose track of expiration dates, if they purchase more food depending on deals, how they shop, where they shop, and whether or not they make a list or not. This lead us to make decisions that allow our design to provide solutions to these problems.

                        Our desk research consisted of information on how much waste was produced in different family sizes, what foods go bad the most often, and where most of food waste comes from.

                <p class="body-para">
                    When journey mapped, we discovered that the last stage of the food waste journey was where the most went wrong. When food sits in the fridge too long, leftovers (one of the largest contributors to food waste) go bad costing the family a potential meal or two. By tackling the problem of food waste in the fridge, we have the opportunity to provide a solution to the last stage of food waste. The multi-media aspect allows us to focus on other parts of the food waste timeline, such as shopping or cooking.

                    The ideation stage consisted of ideas including food scanners, smart containers, smart fridges, handheld scanners and seals that changed color. Many of our ideas were based around reminding users that there food is still fresh, and letting them know what they can make with their food as time the time expires.

                    <p class="body-para">
                        For our final solution, we came up with a multimedia solution which combines smart tupperware and phones to create a seamless experience for users to track leftovers in their fridge. This solves the issue of people forgetting about certain leftovers in their fridge, which eventually get thrown out. Overall, our solution will guide families into being more conscious about their food waste and save money by sending freshness reminders and preservation tips.
