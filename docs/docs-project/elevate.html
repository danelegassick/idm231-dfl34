                    Elevate is a productivity and focus app that helps people beat their phone addiction and elevate their time management in an interesting and pleasant way. Users can earn credits by not using their cell phones and help build real infrastructure around the world with the credits.

                    Elevate was a term long project for a User Interaction class that had students take a pre-existing app, rebrand it, develop new interfaces, improve interaction flow, and animate micro-interactions as the final product.

                <p class="body-para">
                    The app is built for both students and people working remotely. The target audience ranges anywhere from ages 15-30. People younger than 30 often have more issues staying off of their phone and students often fit into this age range. Psychologically, these people either struggle with attention span or anxiety regarding task management.

                    Upon loading in to the app, the user is immediately greeted with the main product, a timer. It can be adjusted using the slider on the side which determines the length of time and size of building. Upon stating the timer, the user will be locked in the app until completion, otherwise the building will fail to complete.

                        Once the building either completes or fails, the user will be brought to the overview page. Here, they will be able to view statistics regarding their focus and what their city looks like, based on how many tasks they have failed of completed. From the overview page, the user can continue on to the Real Build page which allows them to use in app currency to donate real money to developing communities.
